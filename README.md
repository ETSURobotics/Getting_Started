# Getting_Started
This is a repository for resources to get started with when it comes to Robotics and Low-Level Programming

# INTRODUCTION
There are a couple of main fundamental ideas you have to think about when you are just getting started in robotics:
  - A robot needs to interact with the physical world in some way shape or form. (Wheels, legs, arms).
  - A robot needs to sense its environment. (ex. cameras for vision, IMUs for balance, distance sensors for obstacle detection, etc...)
  - A robot needs to make decisions, or have a way for you to make decisions for it. 
  - Every robot needs to have a code behind it telling it what to do and how to do it.
  - Every robot has limiations/constraints. (Power, scale, strength, weight)
