# This club is for people of all skill levels! But here is a good basic start for the people starting from scratch, and also a reminder of concepts for those who are more experienced.


It is important to me to note the reason I wanted to found this club. The world of robotics, of computers, of electrical technology in general has been slowly stripped of passion and originality throughout time, 
and sometimes it can seem bleaker than ever in our modern age.
I believe that robotics is one of the most beautiful and wacky parts of this field, to pump electricity into a bunch of metal and watch it come to life is mind blowing and special and we should remember that.
I hope for this club to be a way to continue to cultivate and grow that love of robotics and our community for years to come. I hope we can see this challenge as not a way to get jobs, or become more "marketable" to employers, but to simply do it because we really want to.
When we read stories like Lord of The Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter... We wish that could be us, we wish this world had magic. Well it does, we pump electrons through wires and in the differences of levels we contrive meaning that turns into instructions that in turn becomes movement.
That process is nothing short of magic, even if it makes logical sense.
So if this is your first time getting into robotics.. Welcome! I am excited to learn more magic with yall. Wingardium leviosa can be written in C and I stand by that.
