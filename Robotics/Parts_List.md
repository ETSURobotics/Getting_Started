# List of suggested parts for a small mobile robot

1. Microcontroller:

    Arduino Uno / Nano (~$5-$10) – Easy to program and widely supported.
    ESP8266 (~$5) – Built-in Wi-Fi if you want remote control or IoT features.

2. Motors:

    DC Motors with Gearbox (~$5 per pair) – Great for basic movement.
    Servo Motors (~$3 each) – For precise rotation and small adjustments.
    Stepper Motors (~$8) – For more accurate control but can be overkill for simple robots.

3. Motor Driver:

    L298N (~$5) – Dual H-Bridge module to control motors.
    L9110S (~$3) – Cheaper and smaller alternative for small motors.

4. Power Supply:

    18650 Li-ion Batteries (~$3 each) or AA Battery Pack (~$2) – Rechargeable or disposable options.
    Battery Holder (~$1) – Depending on battery choice.

5. Wheels and Chassis:

    Cheap Robot Car Kit (~$10) – Includes wheels, motors, and a basic chassis.
    DIY Chassis (Free-$5) – Use cardboard, plastic, or wood.

6. Sensors (Optional but Fun):

    Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) (~$3) – For distance measuring and obstacle avoidance.
    IR Sensors (~$2) – For line-following or object detection.

7. Miscellaneous:

    Jumper Wires (~$2) – For connecting components.
    Breadboard (~$3) – For prototyping.
    Soldering Kit (Optional, ~$10) – For permanent setups.

Estimated Total: $20-$40

This is enough for a basic wheeled robot that can move, avoid obstacles, or follow a line.
